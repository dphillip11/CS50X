## CS50X Online Course with Harvard

This is a collection of the work I submitted as part of the CS50X online course.

In the tries folder you can find a C implementation of a dictionary loader utilising tries. Once the text is parsed, you can you the tool as a spellchecker.

PSET9 contains some dynamic websites utilizing Flask.

PSET8 contains some work more focussed on HTML. 

There are also spellcheckers, image filters, and much more. The earlier problem sets are more focussed on building a repertoire in C.
